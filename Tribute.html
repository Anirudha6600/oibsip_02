                <h2>Personal Life</h2>
           
                <p class="para">
                  Irrfan Khan was born on 7 January 1967 in Tonk, Rajasthan into a Muslim family of Pathani ancestry.
                  Khan's mother, Saeeda Begum Khan was from Tonk, and his father, Yaseen Ali Khan, was from the Khajuriya village in Rajasthan's Tonk district, and they ran a tyre business.
                  He spent his childhood in Tonk, and then Jaipur.
                  Irrfan was good at cricket and was selected to play in the CK Nayudu Trophy for emerging players in the under-23 category, a tournament seen as a stepping stone to first-class cricket in India.
                  However, he did not attend as he could not afford travel expenses.
                  He showed interest in acting under the influence of his maternal uncle who himself was a theatre artist in Jodhpur.
                  In Jaipur, Khan was introduced to noted theatre artists and did several stage performances in the city.
                  Khan completed his MA in Jaipur before joining the National School of Drama (NSD) in New Delhi in 1984 to study acting.
                  In his early days in Mumbai, he took up a job as an air conditioner repairman and visited the home of his acting inspiration, Rajesh Khanna, in 1984.
                  On 23 February 1995, Khan married writer and fellow NSD graduate Sutapa Sikdar.
                  They had two sons, Babil and Ayan.
                  In 2012, he changed the spelling of his first name from "Irfan" to "Irrfan"; he said he liked the sound of the extra "r" in his name.
                  He later dropped "Khan" from his name because according to a 2016 interview, he wanted his work and not his lineage to define him
